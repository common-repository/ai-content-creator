This plugin easily creates articles for new posts for your site using the same AI that powers ChatGPT.

== Description ==

Are you tired of spending hours creating content for your website? Do you want to take your website's content to the next level? Look no further than the AI Content Creator plugin for WordPress!

Looking for an easy and efficient way to create posts for your website? Look no further than AI Content Creator!

With this powerful WordPress plugin, you can quickly generate high-quality content using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. Simply enter a title for your article, click "Create article," and let the plugin do the rest.

Please note that you'll need an OpenAI API key to use the plugin. Don't worry if you don't have one yet; we provide instructions on how to get a free key in the plugin's help section. Once you've used up your free credit, you can continue using the plugin for a low monthly fee.

While AI-generated content is not always perfect, the plugin includes preliminary error checks to help you catch any issues before publishing. Plus, you can preview the content and edit it as needed before creating a post draft and hitting "publish."

After article has been created, you may use the featured image selector included. It offers you a bunch of royalty free suggestions from Pixabay related to the article topic and includes a image search engine to make it as easy as possible.

SEO capabilities include automatic tags for the article, as well as meta keywords and description if the AI creates them and Yoast SEO, All in One SEO or Rank Math SEO are installed and active on your site.

We're constantly working to improve the plugin's capabilities and stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies. In fact, we're planning to add support for upcoming OpenAi's GPT competitors like Google Gemini (Bard), ChatSonic API, Chinchilla, and more.

The plugin supports multiple languages. And if there's a language you need that's not yet supported, just let us know; we're always open to feedback and suggestions.

You can configure the plugin to write articles in these languages:
- English (English)
- Spanish (Español)
- Portuguese (Português)
